# CES-Omega-Flex-reverse-engineering
A collection of information about the CESTronic Omega Flex system I managed to reverse engineer

The CES Omega Flex system seems to be somewhat robust, but dependant on the Management Suite, which has _a few_ downsides.

As such, I started digging into the inner workings of said suite in order to create an open-source alternative.

This repository presents my findings.
