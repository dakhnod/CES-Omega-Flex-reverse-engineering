The Suite software uses a database called Firebird (3.0), apparently running it just as a seperate process.

You can find the databse (.fb30) files under `C:\Program Files\CESsomethingsomething\ifrogottobehonest`.

The larger .fb30 files will hold your users, timetables and such. The SYSTEM one will hold the queue for the upload, for example.
